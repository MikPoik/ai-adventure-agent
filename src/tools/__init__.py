"""Tools for the game.

Tools serve an expanded purpose here from the typical "Agent & Tools" sense: they are micro-utilities which
are designed to be used by EITHER python programmers OR a reasoning AI agent.

For example:

Given the StartQuest tool:

- In pure chat-mode, the CampAgent can choose to begin a quest based on the conversation that the user is having.
- In web-based play, the web app can use an endpoint which manually invokes StartQuest
